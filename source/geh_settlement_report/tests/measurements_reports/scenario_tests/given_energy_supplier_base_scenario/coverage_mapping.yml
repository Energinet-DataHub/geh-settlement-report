  ## PURPOSE
  The purpose is to test base filtering functionality for a report with energy supplier. 

cases_tested:
  "Observation time should be converted to local (CET/CEST) time in report"
  "Report should only include measurement data for grid area(s) included in report (via job parameters)"
  "Report should only include measurement data with observation time => report from date and < report to date (via job parameters)"
  "GIVEN scenario_parameters contains energy_supplier_id THEN output file contains ENERGY SUPPLIER column AND report should only include measurement data for that energy_supplier_id"
  "GIVEN input quantity is null for an observation time THEN that observation time should be included as 0 with quality Missing"
  "GIVEN metering point type is E20 WHEN (grid area owner id != grid_area_code AND (grid area owner id = from_grid_area OR grid area owner id = to_grid_area)) THEN measurement data for this metering point should be included in report for requested period"
  "GIVEN metering point type is D20 WHEN (grid area owner id != grid_area_code AND (grid area owner id = from_grid_area OR grid area owner id = to_grid_area)) THEN measurement data for this metering point should be included in report for requested period"
