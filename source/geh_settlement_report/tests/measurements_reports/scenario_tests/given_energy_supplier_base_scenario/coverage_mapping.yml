  ## PURPOSE
  The purpose is to test base filtering functionality for a report with energy supplier. 

cases_tested:
  "Observation time should be converted to local (CET/CEST) time in report"
  "Report should only include measurement data for grid area(s) included in report (via job parameters)"
  "Report should only include measurement data with observation time => report from date and < report to date (via job parameters)"
  "Columns should be sorted by GRID AREA ID, then METERING POINT TYPE, then METERING POINT ID, then DATE TIME STAMP"
  "GIVEN input quantity is null for an observation time THEN that observation time should be included as 0 with quality Missing"
  "GIVEN metering point type is E20 WHEN (grid area owner id != grid_area_code AND (grid area owner id = from_grid_area OR grid area owner id = to_grid_area)) THEN measurement data for this metering point should be included in report for requested period"
  "GIVEN metering point type is D20 WHEN (grid area owner id != grid_area_code AND (grid area owner id = from_grid_area OR grid area owner id = to_grid_area)) THEN measurement data for this metering point should be included in report for requested period"
