  ## PURPOSE
  The purpose is to test the mapping functionality from input to output values.

  ## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
  On the input side, the full scope of possible known variations (at the time of test creation) for each column is represented (both for metering point data and measurement data). 

cases_tested:
  "Observation time should be converted to local (CET/CEST) time in report"
  "GIVEN scenario_parameters contains no energy_supplier_id THEN output file contains no ENERGY SUPPLIER column"
